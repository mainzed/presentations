# presentations

1. Create a new branch and give it a meaningful name (e.g. "zwei16")
2. Use `PITCHME.md` for your presentation content. Use your own text editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)) 
3. (Optional) Place pictures and logos in /assets. Edit presentation settings in `PITCHME.yml`.
4. Commit your changes and push your branch to github.
5. Go to `https://gitpitch.com/mainzed/presentations/<your-branch-name>` to start your presentation. The master branch is loaded if you ommit the branch name.
